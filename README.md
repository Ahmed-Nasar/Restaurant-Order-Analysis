# Restaurant Operations Analysis

## Project Overview:

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of a restaurant's menu and order data to uncover key insights into customer behavior and ordering trends. The primary goal was to evaluate the performance of various menu categories, assess the impact of pricing and popularity, and identify patterns that could inform strategic decisions. By analyzing data such as order frequencies, customer preferences, and spending behavior across different days of the week, this analysis provides actionable recommendations for optimizing the menu, enhancing customer satisfaction, and boosting sales. Ultimately, the findings aim to help the restaurant make informed, data-driven decisions that will maximize revenue and operational efficiency.

## Dataset Description:
This dataset contains a quarter's worth of orders from a fictitious international cuisine restaurant with a total of 12,266 records and 8 fields.

## EDA Questions:
- What were the least and most ordered items? What categories were they in?
- What were the top 5 orders that spent the most money?
- View the details of the highest spend order. Which specific items were purchased?
- View the details of the top 5 highest spend orders.
- Were there certain times that had more or less orders?
- Which cuisines should we focus on developing more menu items for based on the data?

## Key Insights & Recommendations:
Through this analysis, I identified several critical insights that can directly enhance the restaurant's operations:

- **Cuisines to Prioritize:** Italian cuisine emerged as both the most ordered and the most expensive, indicating an opportunity to expand this category to meet high demand and optimize pricing strategies.
- **Items Needing Attention:** Several menu items were identified as the least ordered, suggesting they may either require targeted promotions or should be considered for removal to streamline the menu.
- **Optimal Times for Promotions:** Order volume analysis revealed peak days (Sunday, Friday and Monday), providing an opportunity to focus promotions or menu updates around these times to boost customer engagement.
